# Data management

# expected data and formats

- The main file formats that I will be using for this project is .jpeg/png which are the formats for most of the images shown in my project. I would also be using txt format for transfering the timeline data.

# documentation and metadata


- Data was place into a folder designated for that file type on my computer. For example, if I was creating an image or acquiring an image I placed it into my images folder. If i was gathering raw data (actual numbers and statistics) it was placed into a raw data folder. 


# sharing, publication, and archiving

- I decided to place my site in the public domain so that anyone can freely use the information I gatherd. I hope this allows it to be easily shared. 

# accessibility

- I included captions underneath each visualization on my site to help people understand what it is. I also made sure to make these images large so that they are not too hard to see.
