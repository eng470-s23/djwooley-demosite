***The Effects of Redlining on the Black Community of Portland*** is a project that aims to educate those unaware of the connections between racism and environmental injustice while also gathering more infomration for those trying to further their own research in understanding ways to bring justice to all communities of people impacted by environmental injustice. 

For this project, I am interested in exploring the long lasting impacts of redlining on the Black community in Portland. With that being said, the content of this project may be too much for some people that are currently experiencing the effects of environmental racism. In no way is this project meant to harm these indivduals. The purpose of this project is to raise more awareness to these issues in order for them to be fixed.

## What is Redlining? 
 
Redlining is defined as a discriminatory practice purposely denying services and loans to individuals from a neighborhood classified as "hazardous" for investment. These neighborhoods have a significant amount of racial and ethnic minorities and low income residents.

Redlining has been directly linked to the racial wealth gap that is relevant today, along with a plethora of other racial economic disparities. Some redlined neighborhoods have done good for themselves by creating their own loan companies. However, food insecurity and heat islands, two factors of enivonmental injustice, still exist in all of these communities. While looking through this site and the research I have gathered, I would like my audience to think about their own neighborhoods, and if any of these topics appear.  

### [What is a Food Desert? ](food-desert.md)

A food desert is classified as an area where the residents have limited access to healthy affordable food. Typically, these neighborhoods are overran with convience and liquor stores and fast food resturants that are within walking distance while the grocery store can be difficult to get to. A lot of the residents in these areas identify as low-income or working class families who may not have cars, making it exptremely diffucult for them to get to their local supermarket.
