# Welcome to my ENG 470 Capstone Project

***The Effects of Redlining on the Black Community of Portland*** is a project that aims to educate those unaware of the connections between racism and environmental injustice while also gathering more infomration for those trying to further their own research in understanding ways to bring justice to all communities of people impacted by environmental injustice. 

The content of this project may be too much for some people that are currently experiencing the effects of environmental racism. In no way is this project meant to harm these indivduals. The purpose of this project is to raise more awareness to these issues in order for them to be fixed.
