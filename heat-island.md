### Heat Islands in Portland

In 2018, the school of Urban Studies and Planning at Portland State University conducted a study after Portland experienced a heat wave. The researchers were interested in finding out which neighborhoods in the city disproportionality experienced the heat wave. They found that [the neighborhoods that experienced the heat wave the worst were those made up of working class minorites](https://www.mdpi.com/1660-4601/15/4/640/htm?h=1).

For this part of my research I looked at the Albina neighborhood. Albina was an industrial neighborhod mostly made up of immigrant workers. After Oregon allowed Black people to move into the state Albina quickly became the only area they were allowed to live in. Due to the influx of immigrants seeking work and Black people being forced into the neighborhood, [it was zoned red or "hazardous" for investment](https://dsl.richmond.edu/panorama/redlining/#loc=13/45.536/-122.683&city=portland-or&area=D2). Now, the neighborhood has become a historic Black neighborhood of Portland.

  I decided to revisit the map, but this time I chose to look for areas that either remianed cool or did not get as hot during the heat wave. In the sea of red, Maywood Park is one of the few neighborhoods that remained cool. This neighborhood was zoned as blue, or B rating. This meant that there was little to no Black or Brown people living in the area, or the location of the neighborhood was not that appealing. The average income in Maywood Park today is about $114,000. the population is around 1,064.

Something that stood out to me the most when doing my researcher on these two neighborhoods was the difference in population. Albina is made up of a group of neighborhoods so its population exceeds Maywood Park. (The neighborhoods that make up Albina were all mapped as being extremely hot). I began to wonder whether or not this also contributed to the extreme heat the people living there experienced. I also looked at images of the neighborhoods. Albina has little to no shading from trees and very few parks/recreation areas to help absorb some of the heat. Whereas,
