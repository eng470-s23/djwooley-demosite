### Heat Islands in Portland

In 2018, the school of Urban Studies and Planning at Portland State University conducted a study after Portland experienced a heat wave. The researchers were interested in finding out which neighborhoods in the city disproportionality experienced the heat wave. They found that [the neighborhoods that experienced the heat wave the worst were those made up of working class minorites](https://www.mdpi.com/1660-4601/15/4/640/htm?h=1).

For this part of my research I looked at the Albina neighborhood. Albina was an industrial neighborhod mostly made up of immigrant workers. After Oregon allowed Black people to move into the state Albina quickly became the only area they were allowed to live in. Due to the influx of immigrants seeking work and Black people being forced into the neighborhood, [it was zoned red or "hazardous" for investment](https://dsl.richmond.edu/panorama/redlining/#loc=13/45.536/-122.683&city=portland-or&area=D2). Now, the neighborhood has become a historic Black neighborhood of Portland.
