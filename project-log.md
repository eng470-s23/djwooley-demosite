## Pitch

- My research topic is: Tracking movement of Black people in Oregon post Civil War, redlining, and now during environmental injustice. 
- My research question is: How have laws during the post civil era, redlining, and environmental injustice impacted the way that Black people move in the state of Oregon? Is redlining the reason why Black people are experiencing environmental injustice?
- I expect to work with the following *materials*: I plan to gather a collection of research and studies that have tracked the movement of Black people since the post civil war era and where Black people were placed during redlining in Oregon. I plan to combine these materials in order to understand the displacement of Black indivduals in Oregon, and if this displacement is the reason why Black people in this state are placed in areas with bad air quality because of factories/industries that contribute to climate change and harming the surrounding environment.
- I plan to *process* these materials by: These materials will be processed by reading and anazlyzing their content, and pulling out important information that contributes to my research question.
- I plan to *present* these materials by: My goal is to present these materials by using an interactive map that follows the three big moments of movement I want to explore (post civil war era, redlining, and now). For the now part of the map I also plan to use data visualization in order to show the disproportionate amount of Black people living near harmful industries or environments harmed by pre-exisiting industries. 
- My final submission will take this form: It will take the form of an interactive map.
- This project is intended to engage these audiences and communities: This project will engage those interested in this topic.
- I bring the following existing knowledge and/or skills to the project: As someone studying journalism, I have had to anazlyze data serval times before and present it in a way that it helpful to my audience. Also, as a Black person, I feel that it is important for those to be educated on the harmful laws and practice that have impacted people within my community and other marganalized communities.
- In order to do this project, I need to learn: I will need to learn how to create an interactive map that would present the above information, and make the data I present look appealing. Aethestics matter.

## reading plan
- Reading research can be very hard. The language can be very confusing and hard to understand. With that being said, I plan to read the more longer book/peer-reviewed articles first so that I am able to make in depth annotations. This will allow me to ask questions and do side research (if needed) on related topics I do not know about.

- *a full citation in Chicago, MLA, APA, or AP style (or another style appropriate to your discipline, with approval)*
- *a 4-5 sentence annotation summarizing the main ideas and content of the piece and discussing how you plan to use it for your project.*

- citation: Gartland Mummery, Lisa. "Understanding and Mitigting Heat in Urban Areas." Taylor and Francis, 2008. 
- summary: So far, I think it is best that I utilize the first two chapters of the text. The first chapter defines a heat island as, a 'reverse oasis' where air and surface temperatures are much higher than the surrounding areas. This chapter also points out the characteristics of a heat island and what impacts they have on the communities they affect. The second chapter

- citation: Smith, Greta. "Congenial Neighbors: Restrictive Convenants and Residential Segregation in Portland, Oregon." Oregon Historical Society, 2018
- summary: In this article, Smith explains exclusionary convenants that made it hard for Black people in Portland (and other cities in Oregon) to have access to housing. Exclusionary convenants were put in place by the developers or owners of a housing building. Many white people in Oregon used this practice in order to "protect" their neighborhoods and their property investments. This practice also made it hard for Black people and other people of color to own property in the city.

- summary: This news aricle from 2020 also highlights the racist housing practices that took place in Oregon and the exclusionary laws. However, this article brought forth a study done by a student at PSU that proves how these practices are impacting people living within a community today. The people living within this community are suffering from heat islands. The article also talks about solutions that can help fix the problem.

## environmental scan
*The environmental scan situates your project within the existing scholarly research and articulates its contribution. Answer each of the following questions in about one well-developed paragraph. You may use bulleted lists to organize your thoughts, but please write in complete sentences.*

### contribution
*Describe what you will do and why. What is unique about your project and what you will be contributing to your scholarly community? What problem will be resolved, what question will be answered, or what opportunity will be created through your project?*

- Originally I thought I planned to use all of the information I gather from my research to create an interactive map that shows the different places that Black people were forced to live and how the environment changed overtime as climate change (and other factors that impact an entire communities health, like building toxic power plants near residential areas) got worse. Now I think it would be more  effecient for me to create an interactive timeline that almost compares or contrast the quality of living that Black people are forced to live in. I also think creating a timeline would help show how long these issues have been issues, but were (probably) never fixed. 

### methods
*What tools and methods will you use, and why are those the best technologies for your purposes?*

- I plan to use Timeline JS in order to make my timeline. This is the best technology for my project because it is free and I believe I need authorization to use it, so it shouldn't take time away from the project. Also the fact that it seems a little straightforward to use. I do not have to download a lot of apps onto my computer in order to use. I can just use the spreadsheet on google. 

### stakeholders / audiences

- I feel that my projection would be intended for both academics interested in environmental injustices and the history of it, and the general public who may have the same interests as those academics and want to learn more. As I do my research I am learning things that I did not know before. The most obvious one being, that I did not know that racist laws and housing codes contributed to people living in horrendious living conditions. These horrendious living conditions are created by other failures of the city and climate change. To, me the interconnectiveness of all of these issues is crazy and important for people to learn about which is why I think the members of the public is a part of my audience. 
### dependencies and resources

- I think that I need to actually carve out the time to work on this project. I have been struggling the most with time management and also trying to find the correct research that works best for my research qurstion. I underestimated how intimidating it can be to research and gather information that is relevant to what I am trying to explore with this project. Since I plan on using Timline JS, I need to start figuring out the logistics of the site (it seems straight forward). I have Professor Burkert to use as a resource if I ever get into a moment when I feel stuck again or am confused about Timeline JS.
