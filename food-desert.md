## Food Deserts in Portland

[In 2019 the Willamette Weekly published an article identifying six food deserts in Portland.](https://www.wweek.com/news/2019/05/30/portlanders-in-food-deserts-can-soon-take-a-lyft-to-the-grocery-store-for-the-same-price-as-a-bus-ticket/#:~:text=Getting%20groceries%20isn't%20an,a%20mile%20to%20get%20groceries.) The article explained a new deal that the city created with Lyft for residents living in these neighborhoods. Lyft will charge them the same as a bus fare when calling a ride to supermarkets. This deal was created to give these residents more options for grocery shopping. 

The Willamette Weekly listed the Argay, Powellhurst gilbert, Pleasant Valley, Centennial and Wilkes neighborhoods as food deserts. For the data below I used the Powellhurst Gilbert neighborhood. I decided to group liquor stores and convience stores together because they both sell food, and Google maps almost always presented convience stores when I was looking for liquor stores (and vice versa). 

The Powellhurst-Gilbert neighborhood has roughly 27,000 residents with a average household income of about $38,000. The residents of this area are mostly Black, Hispanic/Latino, and Asian. [According to the New Deal Map, the Powellhurst-Gilbert neighborhood was zoned yellow.](https://dsl.richmond.edu/panorama/redlining/#loc=14/45.498/-122.588&city=portland-or&area=C31)


Now, the Powellhurst-Gilbert neighborhood has been classified as a food desert. There are more convience stores and fast food resturants in the area than supermarkets.

The map above gives an idea of the situation. There is only one supermarket serving the entire neighborhood. This supermarket may not be easily accesible for those that live at the furthest ends of the neighborhood limits and do not have a car. 







After discovering this information, I thought it woud be interesting to compare this neighborhood to one that was zoned green on the redline map. I chose to look at Eastmoreland. 

About 4,600 people live in Eastmoreland. The average household income in this neighborhood is around $116,000. This neighborhood is more affluent and has been invested in over the decades since it was deemed desriable for investment after the [creation of the redlining map](https://dsl.richmond.edu/panorama/redlining/#loc=13/45.495/-122.655&city=portland-or&area=A13).

Residents of Eastmoreland have more supermarket options which means they have more healthy food options. The supermarkets that they get to chose from have a wide range of prices with Safeway being the cheapest option and New Seasons being the most expensive option. When comparing the sizes of the two neighborhoods, Eastmoreland is much more smaller which means there is no "competition" to get good affordable food.
