## Food Deserts in Portland

[In 2019 the Willamette Weekly published an article identifying six food deserts in Portland.](https://www.wweek.com/news/2019/05/30/portlanders-in-food-deserts-can-soon-take-a-lyft-to-the-grocery-store-for-the-same-price-as-a-bus-ticket/#:~:text=Getting%20groceries%20isn't%20an,a%20mile%20to%20get%20groceries.) The article explained a new deal that the city created with Lyft for residents living in these neighborhoods. Lyft will charge them the same as a bus fare when calling a ride to supermarkets. This deal was created to give these residents more options for grocery shopping. 

The article listed the Argay, Powellhurst gilbert, Pleasant Valley, Centennial and Wilkes neighborhoods as food deserts. For the data below I used the Powellhurst Gilbert neighborhood.
