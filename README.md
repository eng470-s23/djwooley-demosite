# README for demo-site

This repository is a demo for ENG 470/570 students to clone in order to create individual project workspaces. It contains templates for all required components of the final portfolio, written in markdown. (Recommended markdown editor: [dillinger.io](https://dillinger.io/)). 

- **[readme.md](readme.md) (this file)**: a template to record project-level metadata, taken from [UO Libraries' research guide to Doing Digital Projects in the Open](https://researchguides.uoregon.edu/doingdigitalprojectsintheopen/workshop2). To customize it, delete this header section up to the horizontal line (---).
- **[license.md](license.md)**: the license defining how others can reuse your data and other content in your repository.
- **[project-log.md](project-log.md)**: a weekly log for tracking your research notes and progress. This is also where your pitch, draft annotated bibliography, and draft environmental scan go. Revised versions of those materials will likely appear in your white paper.
- **[data-management.md](data-management-plan.md)**: your data management plan, explaining how your project files are stored, named, published, and protected. 
- **[presentation.md](presentation.md)**: visual aids for your presentation at our class symposium in week 9. You may choose instead to use PowerPoint, in which case this file will be presentation.ppt or presentation.pptx.
- **[white-paper.md](white-paper.md)**: final write-up of your project and lessons learned from conceptualizing and prototyping a researched digital humanities project. Your white paper will also contain, embed, or link to the project prototype itself.
- **[_config.yml](_config.yml)**: the file that provides basic styling info to turn your repo into a static website. 
- **[index.md](index.md)**: the front page of your website, which can link to or aggregate any other parts of your repo using relative links.

## Credits and Acknowledgments

This project could not have happened without the plethora of sources provided to me. I would like to thank last spring's ENG 470 class for the research that provided in their Environmental Justice project. A lot of the information for my project was gathered from the research they done. I would also like to acknowledge Professor Burkert and Sophia Polvacih. They helped me narrow done my original big idea to something more focused and specific. I would aslo like to thank the several librarians who have helped me gain access to books that had to be specially ordered for this project. 

Since this project is presenting the many issues of redlining and how it has affected the Black communtiy on an enviromental scale, I would like to acknowledge the many families not only in Portland, but across the country that are still impacted by the reacist descions made by policymakers no longer alive today. This topic can be very sensitive for some, but the work needs to be done in order to move forward as one community of people. I hope this project is able to do that.

I would like to acknowledge that most of this project and research is based on the Chinook land wrongfully taken from them by pioneers in the 1800s. This research was gathered on their land, and is about their land.
