# What's a White Paper?

In digital humanities, it is common for project teams to publish a report of funded development activities after a grant cycle is completed. The following template is taken from the [instructions provided by the National Endowment for the Humanities](https://www.neh.gov/how-write-successful-white-paper-tips-odh) to recipients of Digital Humanities Advancement Grants.

## Project Summary/Abstract (1 paragraph) 

Redlining was a racially motivated zoning tactic that allowed many cities in the United States to still control the movement of Black and Brown communitites after the Supereme Court deemed racially segregated neighborhoods unconstitutional. In Portland: developers, renters, and realty board personnel, and property owners created a rule stating it would be unethical to sell property to a non-white person in an all white neighborhood. This rule began to appear in the form of racially restrictive covenants. Fast forward to the New Deal era, redlining and racially motivated zoning become a new popular practice across cities in America. The impacts of redlining are prevelant and expereinced by low-income Black and Brown people that still live in the under-invested neighborhoods today. 

A food desert is created when there is a community of people that live in an area without access to healthy and affordable food. Food deserts have been found in areas where the majority are low-income Black and/or Brown people. An indicator of a food desert is when the number of convience stores and fast food resturants out number the amount of grocery stores. In these nighborhoods there are typically one grocery store with low qualuty produce and an insuffecient range of healthy food options for the community.  
## Project Origins and Goals

When I began to brainstorm ideas for my project, I kept thinking about environmental racism. However, I was more interested in exploring how this issues has impacted the movement of the Black community of Oregon. When I realized this was too big of a topic to tackle, Professor Burkert made me realize that I should focus on a specific topic in regards to environmental racism. So, I began to think about redlining and how Black people and other minority groups were almost forced to live in designated neighborhoods, and left to fend for themselves. These people hardly had any political power, and the city government/officials failed to invest in their communities. This failure led to the disparaities that have been existing before I was born. 

My goal for this project is to educate people on one of the many impacts of racism that cannot be forgotten when a conversation about envionmental justice takes place. For my audience that already knew the connections between racism and environmental injustice then I hope the research that I have done is beneficial for them in furthering their own research on fixing this issue.  
## Project Activities, Team, and Participants

## Project Outcomes

In order to create this project I gathered a lot of data. With that data I created a timeline that touches the sruface of the impacts of redlining. I have also created an interactive map using the New Deal zoning map. On this map my audience will find the current issues that certain neighborhoods in Portland are expereincing today in regards to environmental racism and being poorly invested in. I did this in order to show the outcomes of the New Deal map and how its creators created their ideal society, today. 
## Project Continuation and Long-Term Impact

As stated in my goals, I hope that scholars interested in researching this topic are able to use the information I gathered in order to inform their own research. Since this project is centered around research, I would like for others to add to the research and expand more on the ideas that I present.
